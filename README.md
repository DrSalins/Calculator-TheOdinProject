# Calculator Project

A web-based calculator built as part of The Odin Project curriculum. This assignment was both challenging and rewarding, allowing me to deepen my understanding of JavaScript logic, DOM manipulation, and user interaction patterns.

Developing this project strengthened my problem-solving skills and demonstrated how dynamic user interfaces can be created and updated in real time.

## Features

- Core Mathematical Operations: Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (×), Division (÷)
- Special Functions: Percentages (%), Decimals, Positive/Negative Toggle (+/-)
- Keyboard Support: Fully operable via keyboard shortcuts for enhanced usability
- Dynamic Display & Error Handling: Updates in real time with edge case handling (e.g., dividing by zero, multiple decimals)

## Tech Stack

- HTML – for semantic structure
- CSS – for styling and layout
- JavaScript – for interactivity, arithmetic logic, and event handling

## Key Learnings

- Implemented arithmetic logic with operator handling and edge case validation
- Dynamically updated the DOM to reflect user input and results
- Built keyboard navigation to mirror button functionality, enhancing accessibility
- Strengthened debugging and logical reasoning skills through iterative testing
